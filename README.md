# 👋 Hi, I'm Barnak!

## 🚀 About Me
I'm a **3rd year B.Tech student in Information Technology** at **Techno Main Salt Lake**, and an aspiring **AI Developer** passionate about building intelligent applications that leverage the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and modern AI frameworks. My focus is on creating production-ready AI solutions with a strong emphasis on **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, **LangChain**, and **LangGraph**.

Currently expanding my skill set to include **backend development** to build end-to-end AI-powered applications.

## 🎯 Current Focus Areas

### 🤖 AI & Machine Learning
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Building context-aware AI systems that combine LLMs with external knowledge bases
- **LangChain**: Developing sophisticated LLM applications with chains, agents, and memory systems
- **LangGraph**: Creating stateful, multi-actor AI applications with complex workflows
- **Vector Databases**: Working with embeddings and semantic search (Pinecone, Chroma, Weaviate)
- **Prompt Engineering**: Crafting effective prompts for various use cases

### 🛠️ Backend Development (Learning)
- **API Development**: RESTful and GraphQL APIs
- **Databases**: SQL and NoSQL database design
- **Cloud Services**: AWS, Azure, or GCP for scalable deployments
- **Microservices Architecture**: Building modular, maintainable systems
- **Authentication & Security**: Implementing secure user authentication and authorization
